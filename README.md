## Description

The project consists of simulating the operation of an e-commerce using React, React hooks, React-router for routing, Material UI as a library in charge of the components with a default style, React Material UI Form Validator for the validation of the form, React Toastify for the notifications, and Firebase as a database. As for styles, I style it with pure CSS and for some animations I use the animate.css library.
